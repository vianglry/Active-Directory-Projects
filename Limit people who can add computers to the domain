By default, every user in an Active Directory Domain can add up to 10 computers to your domain. We would obviously like to change 
that to something more limiting in order to maintain control over devices in our environment. This group policy object
change will adjust the Default Domain Policy to allow security groups determnined by the IT department to add computers.



Create a group

Open Group Policy Management
Go to Group Policy Management > Forest > Domains > _Name of your domain_
Right-click 'Default Domain Policy'
In the dialoug box that appears, click 'Edit'

This will open the Group Policy Management Edidtor for the 'Default Domain Policy'

Go to Default Domain Policy > Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies
In the right-side window click 'Add workstations to domain' Policy
Tick 'Define these policy setting:'
click 'Add User or Group'
In the new dialouge box, type the name of the user groups allowed to add computers to the domain
